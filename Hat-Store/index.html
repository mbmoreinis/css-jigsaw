    <p><strong>Instructions: </strong> We created a hat store using some important layout properties: setting a parent width to a fixed size, using inline-block to style elements in a row, floating sections with border-box styling so that margins and padding don't interfere with percent dimensions, 
and clearing floated elements to move a footer below them.</p>
    <p>We've given you the instructions in the style section of the solution page - you just have to apply them and notice what happens. Read about the layout choices in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp">CSS Website Layout</a> but there are many different code choices there, so you can't copy/paste to do this.</p>
    <p>3-column layouts like this work on desktop sites, but not mobile.  There are ways to make layouts responsive so that as you make the widths narrow, the elements that can shrink do, while others jump below.  This doesn't do that yet, though you could play around and make it do that some day. </p>
