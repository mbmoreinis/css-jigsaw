    <h1>Concentration</h1>
    <h3>CSS Dropdowns</h3>
    <h4>By: Mason</h4>
     <p><strong>Instructions: </strong> You'll see a 12-box grid on the <a href="solution.html">Solution Page</a>.  Hovering over the first 6 boxes displays  overcontent it. With regular drop-down menus, the content is below and shifted, but here, it's directly on top.</p>
    <h4>Your task:</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Add some Dropdown CSS</strong>: Dropdowns are based on the :hover pseudoclass, and use the display property to hide the dropdown elements by default. Create a CSS declaration that says that when you hover over the parent, the dropdown-content div should be displayed, and another to give that child element absolute positioning. At that point, it will behave like the video below this list.</li>
  <li><strong>Build a Concentration Game board</strong>, adding ID selectors to the CSS so that each dropdown 1-6  has a match. Note: two of the boxes have text content in the HTML, so you'll have to add that to the boxes you pick.</li>
  <li><strong>Substitute your own images and/or text</strong> in place of those here to create your own drop-down concentration game! Based on the sizes of your background images, you may have to adjust things.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert Concentration to Flashcards</strong> by finding definitions for terms to study.  Put the definitions in the HTML dropdown-content divs and the terms in the jargon spans.</li>
</ol>
