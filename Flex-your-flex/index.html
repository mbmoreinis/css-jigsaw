    <h1>Hat Store</h1>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <h4>By Chris & Aedan</h4>
    <p><strong>Instructions: </strong> To do this assignment we had to learn a lot about flex and work through tons of problems.  We've decided to give it to you with the solution and let you play around. The version below is the original, and as you change the width of the browser you will see the sizes change proportionally. What you want to see is something more elegant, like what is on the solution page.</p>
      You will need to change the row of columns in the middle (around and including the hat image) to flex whenever you change the size of the window.  You'll see how we started to use media queries to change the size and position of the hat, and how we finally stacked the columns when the width was 800px and below.  There's much more to do but we ran out of time.</p>
